FOR THE MAIN ONE! first copy the code, then put the code in a bookmark, then go onto all of your ext by clicking the puzzle icon and manage extensions, click on goguardian, on the url you can see = and then a bunch of numbers, copy the numbers, go back to all your extensions, go on the google dictionary or smth, scroll down until you see view extension in webstore, btw goguardian isnt on the webstore so there isnt a link to it, when you click view extension just spam the escape key as fast as you can once you clicked on it, then click on the bookmark, press ok and then paste the numbers you copied, now goguardian should be glitching so yeah theres no more goguardian
FOR THE BETTER ONE! do the same thing like the main one just paste the code and make it a bookmark thats it for now, then you will go to this link, https://tinyurl.com/goofguardian it may say its blocked but thats fine, if it shows a blank page click on the bookmark you just made, i will tell you to not use the one that will kill it fully, just the one that will disable it until restart. if u get suspended that sucks for you, i just made this for fun.
